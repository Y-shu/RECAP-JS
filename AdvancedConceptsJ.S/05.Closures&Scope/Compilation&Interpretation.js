/*JAVASCRIPT is both compiled and Interpreted Language...
1.What is Interpretation?
The run time executes the code directly without and compilation step
2.Compilation actaully converts source code into an intermediatory code
or even the final object code
3.In javascript source code which is written by us is executed by browser.
4.But the is also an compilation step browser does before it acutally executes it
5.Actually when the browser gets the execution code there are two steps that the browser
executes:
    First Step:Is the compilation (browser looking at your source code and identifying
        a set of things which it needs inorder to execute it)
        **but point here is not to generate the intermediatory file but to look 
        for signs and to make note of certain things which it needs to execute it
    Second Step:Interpretation step--where actually code is executed
6.These two steps executed very quickly
