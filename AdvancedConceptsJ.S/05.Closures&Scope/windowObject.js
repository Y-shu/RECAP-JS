//Global object holds all global variables
//the root object or the global object depends on which run time you are using
//for example: fire fox or chrome...
//NOTE:When we run javascript in browser the global object is "window" object
//what ever the variables that we create they get created at global level in global
//object called---WINDOW....Same with properties...
