EVENT LOOP
1. Node js is an asynchronous, single threaded and event driven 
2. Event loop mechanism which is efficient which helps node js be a 
   single threaded application.
•	call stack
•	API’s (web)
•	Event loop
**call stack is the structure in the memory where we currently executing code 
**API’s are nothing but browser (where we offload some of the work by nodejs)….
  this particular part deals with handling left over works like set time out 
  [nodejs comes with some c++ apis  which interact with OS)
  API’s are mechanism provided by browser to handle certain portion of code
**Event loop is like FIFO used by nodejs to list all tasks. When call stack
 is empty , event loop is going to throw tasks into call stack where task is 
 supposed to get executed.

 Q3. What is Event loop in Node.js work? And How does it work?
     
	 **Event loop handles all async call backs
	 ** all the callback functions are queued in an loop, and 
	    will run one-by-one when the response has been received.
