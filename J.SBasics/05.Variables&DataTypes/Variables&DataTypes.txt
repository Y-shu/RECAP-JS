VARIABLES:
//variable is nothing but a named storage 
//once we create a variable this holds a particular 
memory in RAM with some address which is basically a 
//hexadecimal number
//this stored variable can be referenced and manipulated
//we can store any type of data to these variables

DATA TYPES:
1.Data types are of two types Primitive/Trivial(their value will not change)
 and Composite/Non-Primitive(values will be changing)
2.Primitive--->Number,String and Boolean
  Trivial--->null and undefined.
3.Non-Primitive--->Objects and Arrays.
4.J.s is loosely typed programming language , as we need not define the data type
during declaring variable like int x=5;
5.J.s is dynamically typed as we assign a number to variable its datatype is changed 
accordingly.Depending on the type of value , data type of variable changes

RULES TO NAME A VARIABLES:
1.Should not be a pre-defined keyword
