DOM(Document Object Model):

For web development we need:
1.HTML(Hyper Text Mark up language)--Adds structure to web page
									Genetrally uses tags
2.CSS(cascading style sheets)--Adds style to web page
								uses ids, classes and attributes
3.JavaScript--Adds Programming to web page(Functionality)

HOW JS INTERACT WITH HTML?
Js cannot understand HTML so it takes help of DOM
1.Html document gets loaded in the browser 
2.corresponing to this document another document which is representation of this doc is
  made
  
  *** all tags in html are represnted as objects in  DOM..
  why?
  JS can easily interpret this object.
  Js use these objects to manipulate their attributes
  
  In DOM we have three different nodes they are :
  1.Element node(tag itself)
  ***Object will have an attribute and some methods related to it
  2.Attribute node(attributes applied to tags)
  3.text node(nothing but values)
